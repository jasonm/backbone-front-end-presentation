# Web apps shifting client-side

# Presenter Notes

* These days, some web apps have more code on the client than on the server.
* Who is seeing these trends?  What are you doing about it?
* How much JS?

    * Airbrake: Almost 0
    * Copycopter: 30%
    * Trajectory 41%
    * IoraHealth: 62%

* Hands up: Back end, front end, javascript, js MVC/MVVM frameworks 

---
# Organize your JavaScript

# Presenter Notes

* Where do frameworks come from?
* Paradigm -> path-least-resistance -> implementation -> architecture -> technical debt
* Server: Req/response (CGI, EHTML) -> procedural & tag soup *SP.
* Client: Async ($) -> Deeply nested callbacks (if-like), Stateful (DOM) -> app data stored in the DOM.
* Patterns for organization.  MVC is one.  Good for GUI.
* MVC over HTTP is often stateless.  Some state maintained with session
* CS-MVC in GUI is stateful.  THIS IS OKAY!

---
# But which framework?

* SproutCore 2.0
* Knockout.js
* Batman.js
* JavaScriptMVC
* Spine.js
* Backbone.js
* Angular, Coherent, PureMVC-js, AFrameJS, TrimPath Junction,...

# Presenter Notes

* [Decision Fatigue NY Times Mag article](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html)
* SC2: Similar, larger.  Less doc.  Declarative bindings, even in templates.
* Knockout: MVVM.  WCF, Silverlight.
* Batman: Node server, share models, data-bind templates
* JavaScriptMVC: Larger, older, generators, dep mgmt, builds, testing, jQuery-based-and-like, JSON/REST transport
* Spine.js: Very similar.  Even smaller.  Coffee.  Fully async, client rules.
* Backbone: Small, readable, intended for modification, extracted from DocumentCloud

* History
* Router
* View
* Model
* Collection

# Presenter Notes

* History - Handles hashchange, pushstate, BB.history.start()
* Router - read fragment, dispatch to action
* View - Takes model data, presents in DOM.  Binds to DOM events, triggers app logic.  1:1 `el`, `this.$`, `events`, `$.delegate`, templating
* Model - Conversions, computed properties, validations, access control, events change/change:attr,destroy,error
* Collection - Ordered set of models.  URL, fetch(), reset(json), _.methods, comparator, events reset/add/remove/all model events
* Sync - Encapsulation of persistence. Default `$.ajax` to RESTful JSON API.  Designed for override, global or per-class.
* Underscore -  FP (select, reduce), bind, template, deep isEqual, clone, tap
* $ - jQuery || Zepto
